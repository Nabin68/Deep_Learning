# Deep Learning Practice

This repository contains my practice codes and experiments while learning **Deep Learning**.  
The goal is to build a strong foundation by implementing concepts from scratch as well as using frameworks like **TensorFlow** and **PyTorch**.

## Contents
- Basics of Neural Networks (Perceptron, Activation Functions, Backpropagation)
- Training & Optimization (SGD, Adam, Loss Functions)
- Regularization & Dropout
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs)
- Autoencoders & Embeddings
- Experimentation with real-world datasets (MNIST, CIFAR, IMDB, etc.)
- Model evaluation and visualization

## Purpose
- Strengthen understanding of Deep Learning concepts
- Practice coding implementations step by step
- Build a reference collection for future projects

## Tech Stack
- Python üêç
- TensorFlow / Keras
- PyTorch
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
